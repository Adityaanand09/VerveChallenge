The distributed streaming service for building extension 
3 is chosen as Kafka, since it is 
1. Scalable: It is horizontally scalable since more brokers can always be added
2. Fault Tolerance : Since it replicates data across various brokers
3. Distributed architecture: Kafka provides separation between message producers and consumers.
